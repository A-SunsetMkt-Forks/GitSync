GitSync is an Android git client that aims to simplify the process of syncing a folder between a git remote and a local directory. It works in the background to keep your files synced with a simple one-time setup and numerous options for activating manual syncs

- Authenticate with Github.com
- Clone a remote repository
- Sync repository
    - Fetch changes
    - Pull changes
    - Commit new changes
    - Push changes
    - **Resolve merge conflicts**
- Sync mechanisms
    - From a quick tile
    - When an app is opened or closed
    - From a custom intent (advanced)
- Settings
    - Customise sync message
    - Edit .gitignore file

## Build Instructions

If you just want to try the app out, feel free to use a pre-built release from the [Releases](https://github.com/ViscousPotential/GitSync/releases) page

### 1. Setup 
- Clone the project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ViscousPot/GitSync.git
```


- Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd GitSync
```

- Open the project in Android Studio
- Sync the gradle project

### 2. Secrets 
- Rename `Secrets.kt.template` to `Secrets.kt`
- Visit `https://github.com/settings/developers`
- Select `OAuth Apps`
- Select `New OAuth App`
  - Application Name: GitSync
  - Homepage URL: `https://github.com/ViscousPot/GitSync`
  - Authorization callback URL: `gitsync://auth`
  - Enable Device Flow: `leave unchecked` 
- Fill `Secrets.kt` with the new OAuth App ID and SECRET

### 3. Build & Run
- There are two flavors of GitSync
  - The base variant
    - Includes all the base functionality of GitSync, but doesn't have access to some files and folders on the device
    - Equivalent to the version available on the PlayStore
  - The all-files variant
    - Includes all the functionality of the base variant + an extra permission to give the app full access to the device files and folders
    - This is useful if you already have a repository cloned on your device
    - GitSync does not access any files outside of the directory selected in the app nor is anything stored or sent from the selected directory
- Select a build variant (base is the default)
- Build from within Android Studio
